# Mileage Log Realism Improvement Plan

## Current Issues Identified

After analyzing the most recent mileage log entries in the database, we've identified several areas where the generated logs could be more realistic:

1. **Location-Purpose Mismatches**
   - Example: "School Drop-off/Pick-up" with location "Chipotle Restaurant"
   - Example: "Gym/Fitness" with location "Elementary School"
   - Example: "Pet Care" with location "Public Library"
   - Example: "Vacation" with location "Holiday Market" with only 3.1 miles

2. **Distance-Purpose Inconsistencies**
   - Short distances for purposes that typically require longer trips
   - Example: "Vacation" with only 3.1 miles
   - Example: "Conference" with only 4.2 miles

3. **Unrealistic Trip Sequences**
   - Multiple business trips on the same day without returning to a home base
   - Consecutive trips without logical flow (e.g., office → client → office)
   - Missing commuting patterns on workdays

4. **Mileage Distribution Issues**
   - Too many small-mileage trips (1-5 miles)
   - Not enough medium-range trips (15-30 miles)
   - Unrealistic business/personal ratio for certain days

5. **Temporal Patterns Missing**
   - No distinction between morning, afternoon, and evening trips
   - Weekday vs weekend patterns not sufficiently differentiated

## Detailed Improvement Plan

### Phase 1: Purpose-Location Coherence

#### 1.1 Create Purpose-Location Mapping
```typescript
// Implementation in locationUtils.ts
const PURPOSE_LOCATION_MAPPING: Record<string, string[]> = {
  // Personal purposes
  "School Drop-off/Pick-up": ["Elementary School", "Middle School", "High School", "Private School", "Daycare Center"],
  "Gym/Fitness": ["Planet Fitness", "LA Fitness", "YMCA", "Local Gym", "Recreation Center"],
  "Pet Care": ["Veterinarian", "PetSmart", "Petco", "Dog Park", "Groomer"],
  "Grocery Shopping": ["Kroger", "Safeway", "Whole Foods", "Trader Joe's", "Local Grocery"],
  "Medical Appointment": ["Doctor's Office", "Medical Center", "Clinic", "Hospital", "Specialist Office"],
  "Religious Activity": ["Church", "Temple", "Mosque", "Worship Center", "Religious School"],
  "Commuting": ["Office", "Workplace", "Business Center", "Company HQ"],
  // Add mappings for all other purposes
};
```

#### 1.2 Enhance getPersonalLocation Function
```typescript
function getPersonalLocation(purpose: string, miles: number): string {
  // First check if we have specific locations for this purpose
  if (purpose in PURPOSE_LOCATION_MAPPING) {
    const specificLocations = PURPOSE_LOCATION_MAPPING[purpose];
    return getRandomItem(specificLocations);
  }
  
  // Fall back to distance-based location if no specific mapping
  const distanceCategory = findDistanceCategory(miles);
  return getRandomItem(PERSONAL_LOCATIONS[distanceCategory]);
}
```

### Phase 2: Distance-Purpose Correlation

#### 2.1 Define Purpose-Distance Relationships
```typescript
const PURPOSE_DISTANCE_RANGES = {
  // Personal purposes
  "Vacation": { min: 50, max: 500, preferredCategory: "veryFar" },
  "Family Visit": { min: 10, max: 200, preferredCategory: "medium" },
  "Entertainment": { min: 5, max: 50, preferredCategory: "medium" },
  "Commuting": { min: 5, max: 30, preferredCategory: "near" },
  "School Drop-off/Pick-up": { min: 1, max: 10, preferredCategory: "veryNear" },
  "Grocery Shopping": { min: 1, max: 8, preferredCategory: "veryNear" },
  
  // Business purposes
  "Conference": { min: 15, max: 300, preferredCategory: "far" },
  "Client Visit": { min: 5, max: 50, preferredCategory: "medium" },
  "Site Inspection": { min: 10, max: 60, preferredCategory: "medium" },
  // Add ranges for all other purposes
};
```

#### 2.2 Implement Purpose-Aware Mileage Distribution
```typescript
function generateTripMileage(purpose: string, tripType: 'business' | 'personal'): number {
  const range = PURPOSE_DISTANCE_RANGES[purpose] || {
    min: 1,
    max: 20,
    preferredCategory: "near"
  };
  
  // Generate mileage within the appropriate range with some variation
  const baseMileage = getRandomMileage(range.min, range.max);
  
  // Add some randomness but keep within realistic bounds
  const variation = 0.8 + Math.random() * 0.4; // 80-120% variation
  return roundToOneDecimal(baseMileage * variation);
}
```

### Phase 3: Trip Sequence Logic

#### 3.1 Implement Home-Base Trip Patterns
```typescript
function generateDailyTripSequence(date: Date, businessMiles: number, personalMiles: number): TripSequence {
  const trips: Trip[] = [];
  const isWorkDay = isWorkday(date);
  const homeBase = "Home";
  let currentLocation = homeBase;
  
  // Morning pattern
  if (isWorkDay && businessMiles > 0) {
    // 80% chance of morning commute
    if (Math.random() < 0.8) {
      const commuteMiles = getRandomMileage(5, 15);
      trips.push({
        startLocation: homeBase,
        endLocation: "Office",
        purpose: "Commuting",
        miles: commuteMiles,
        timeOfDay: "morning"
      });
      currentLocation = "Office";
      businessMiles -= commuteMiles;
    }
  }
  
  // Midday pattern
  if (currentLocation === "Office" && businessMiles > 0) {
    // 60% chance of business trip during day
    if (Math.random() < 0.6) {
      const businessPurpose = getRandomBusinessPurpose(businessType);
      const businessMiles = generateTripMileage(businessPurpose, 'business');
      
      trips.push({
        startLocation: currentLocation,
        endLocation: getBusinessLocation(businessPurpose),
        purpose: businessPurpose,
        miles: businessMiles,
        timeOfDay: "midday"
      });
      
      // Return to office
      trips.push({
        startLocation: getBusinessLocation(businessPurpose),
        endLocation: "Office",
        purpose: businessPurpose,
        miles: businessMiles,
        timeOfDay: "midday"
      });
    }
  }
  
  // Evening pattern - return home
  if (currentLocation === "Office" && isWorkDay) {
    trips.push({
      startLocation: currentLocation,
      endLocation: homeBase,
      purpose: "Commuting",
      miles: commuteMiles, // Same as morning commute
      timeOfDay: "evening"
    });
    currentLocation = homeBase;
  }
  
  // Personal trips typically start and end at home
  if (personalMiles > 0 && currentLocation === homeBase) {
    const personalPurpose = getWeightedPersonalPurpose(date);
    const personalTripMiles = generateTripMileage(personalPurpose, 'personal');
    
    const personalLocation = getPersonalLocation(personalPurpose, personalTripMiles);
    
    trips.push({
      startLocation: homeBase,
      endLocation: personalLocation,
      purpose: personalPurpose,
      miles: personalTripMiles,
      timeOfDay: isWorkDay ? "evening" : "midday"
    });
    
    trips.push({
      startLocation: personalLocation,
      endLocation: homeBase,
      purpose: personalPurpose,
      miles: personalTripMiles,
      timeOfDay: isWorkDay ? "evening" : "afternoon"
    });
  }
  
  return convertToMileageEntries(trips);
}
```

### Phase 4: Enhanced Seasonal and Temporal Awareness

#### 4.1 Expand Seasonal Location Options
```typescript
const SEASONAL_PURPOSE_LOCATIONS: Record<string, Record<string, string[]>> = {
  winter: {
    "Vacation": ["Ski Resort", "Mountain Cabin", "Holiday Destination", "Winter Retreat"],
    "Entertainment": ["Ice Skating Rink", "Winter Festival", "Holiday Market", "Indoor Theater"],
    "Shopping": ["Holiday Market", "Shopping Mall", "Christmas Bazaar"],
    "Family Visit": ["Family Home", "Holiday Gathering", "Relative's House"]
  },
  spring: {
    "Vacation": ["Beach Resort", "National Park", "Spring Break Destination"],
    "Entertainment": ["Botanical Garden", "Spring Festival", "Outdoor Concert"],
    "Shopping": ["Farmers Market", "Garden Center", "Outlet Mall"],
    "Family Visit": ["Family Home", "Easter Gathering", "Graduation Ceremony"]
  },
  summer: {
    "Vacation": ["Beach Resort", "Lake House", "National Park", "Summer Cabin"],
    "Entertainment": ["Water Park", "Amusement Park", "Outdoor Concert", "Baseball Game"],
    "Shopping": ["Farmers Market", "Outdoor Mall", "Flea Market"],
    "Family Visit": ["Family Reunion", "Summer Cookout", "Vacation Home"]
  },
  fall: {
    "Vacation": ["Wine Country", "Fall Foliage Tour", "Mountain Retreat"],
    "Entertainment": ["Football Game", "Fall Festival", "Harvest Fair", "Corn Maze"],
    "Shopping": ["Farmers Market", "Pumpkin Patch", "Apple Orchard"],
    "Family Visit": ["Thanksgiving Gathering", "Family Home", "Harvest Celebration"]
  }
};
```

#### 4.2 Implement Time-of-Day Awareness
```typescript
type TimeOfDay = "morning" | "midday" | "afternoon" | "evening";

function getTimeOfDayProbabilities(date: Date, purpose: string): Record<TimeOfDay, number> {
  const isWeekday = isWorkday(date);
  
  if (purpose === "Commuting") {
    return {
      morning: isWeekday ? 0.45 : 0.1,
      midday: 0.1,
      afternoon: 0.1,
      evening: isWeekday ? 0.35 : 0.1
    };
  }
  
  if (purpose === "School Drop-off/Pick-up") {
    return {
      morning: 0.45,
      midday: 0.1,
      afternoon: 0.4,
      evening: 0.05
    };
  }
  
  // Default distribution
  return {
    morning: isWeekday ? 0.2 : 0.25,
    midday: isWeekday ? 0.3 : 0.3,
    afternoon: isWeekday ? 0.2 : 0.3,
    evening: isWeekday ? 0.3 : 0.15
  };
}
```

### Phase 5: Mileage Distribution Refinement

#### 5.1 Implement More Realistic Daily Patterns
```typescript
function generateDailyDistribution(
  dates: Date[],
  totalBusinessMiles: number,
  totalPersonalMiles: number,
  startMileage: number,
  businessType?: string
): DailyMileageDistribution[] {
  // Improved distribution logic
  
  // 1. Allocate miles based on day of week with more nuance
  const weekdayBusinessWeight = 0.85; // 85% of business miles on weekdays
  const weekendPersonalWeight = 0.7;  // 70% of personal miles on weekends
  
  // 2. Consider seasonal variations
  const month = new Date().getMonth();
  const seasonalFactor = getSeasonalMileageFactor(month);
  
  // 3. Create more realistic trip patterns
  // - More commuting on weekdays
  // - More shopping/entertainment on weekends
  // - More vacation miles during summer/holidays
  
  // 4. Implement minimum trip thresholds
  // - Business trips typically 5+ miles
  // - Personal trips can be shorter
  
  // 5. Create logical trip sequences
  // - Home → Work → Client → Work → Home
  // - Home → Store → Home
  // - Home → Multiple Errands → Home
}
```

#### 5.2 Implement Weekly Patterns
```typescript
function distributeWeeklyMileage(weekDates: Date[], totalMiles: number, businessRatio: number): WeeklyDistribution {
  // Create realistic weekly patterns
  // - Monday: Medium mileage (back to work)
  // - Tuesday-Thursday: Highest business mileage
  // - Friday: Medium mileage
  // - Saturday: Highest personal mileage
  // - Sunday: Lowest total mileage
  
  const mondayFactor = 0.9;
  const midweekFactor = 1.2;
  const fridayFactor = 0.95;
  const saturdayFactor = 1.0;
  const sundayFactor = 0.7;
  
  // Apply these factors to create a realistic weekly distribution
}
```

### Phase 6: Integration and Testing

#### 6.1 Refactor Generation Pipeline
- Update the main generation function to incorporate all improvements
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing code
- Maintain performance while adding complexity

#### 6.2 Implement Validation
```typescript
function validateMileageLog(log: MileageLog): ValidationResult {
  // Check for realistic patterns
  // Verify purpose-location matches
  // Ensure appropriate mileage for purposes
  // Validate trip sequences
  
  return {
    isValid: true,
    issues: [],
    realism: 0.95 // 0-1 scale
  };
}
```
